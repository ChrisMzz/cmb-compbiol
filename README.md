# A model of sympatric speciation with two evolving traits

This is [Chris Mzz.](https://github.com/ChrisMzz) and [alalice](https://github.com/alalice)'s project for Computational Biology.

Relevant results and documents will be in their respective folders. The Python code used to work on the project will be in the `source` folder.

## Presentation of the project framework

> This project aims at studying the effect of a second trait under directional selection in a classical model of competitive sympatric speciation. To keep things simple, we will only analyze the asexual case (which makes the term speciation somewhat debatable).
